Hello

The pdf file is the main report.

The LogisticRegressor.py is the script that actualy performs logistic regression and is used by LogRegTaiwan.py. When run as main it
performs unit test on some small data sets

The Network.py file is the neural network and is used by NetFranke.py and NetTaiw.py. When run as main it performs unit test using a small dataset to classify handwritten digits.

The logRegTaiwan.py, NetTaiw.py and NetFranke use the previously afore mentioned files to solve the challenges posed in the project.

The  dataloader.py file has been abandoned. It was used early in the project to experiment with the datasets.

The gridsearch folder contains results from gridsearches

Plot folder contains various additional plots that were made during the project
